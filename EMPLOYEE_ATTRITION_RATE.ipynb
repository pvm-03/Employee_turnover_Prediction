    "## Findings after performing Analysis :-\n",
    "#### Based on Age:\n",
    "Range of age is between 18 years to 60 years: This company has employees across the spectrum from recent graduates to the retirement age. Since the maximum age bracket with highest number of employees are between 30 -36, we can safely assume that the company prefers employees who have considerable work experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Based on Department:\n",
    "Since 65% of the employees are in Research and development, we can assume that the company activities include innovation and introducing new products and services. Ostensibly, the goal of the company would be to take new products and services to market and add to the company's bottom line.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Based on Education Field:\n",
    "Since 41% and 31% of the employees are from the Life sciences and medical backgrounds respectively, we can say that the company is majorly based out of bio-technology and R&D. This further strengthens our earlier propositions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Based on Environment Satisfaction:\n",
    "Since more than 60% of the employees have voted for the top 2 categories in environment satisfaction, we can say that the majority of employees feel comfortable working in this organization. However, 40% of the employees seem to need improvement in their working environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Based on Job Satisfaction:\n",
    "Only 30% of employees in the organization have given the highest rating for job satisfaction. This shows that there is still a lot of room for improvement. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Based on Marital Status:\n",
    "As 45% of the employees in the organization are married, the company appears to give a stable and well-paying job profile to the employees. Marital status is also an important indicator of organisational commitment. Generally, married people are more committed to their organisation than unmarried people.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Based on Monthly Income:\n",
    "It is negatively correlated to attrition. Lesser the Monthly Income, higher the attrition rate. Employees with salary around 2500 are more prone to leave the company.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Based on WorkLifeBalance :\n",
    "60% of employees have given second best rating. This could again hint at a 'neutral response bias' and it involves a certain subjectivity of interpreting a correct work-life balance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Based on Years At Company:\n",
    "The dataset reveals that a majority of the employees (75%) have a work experience of less than 9 years at the company. There appears to be a tapering down of career progression above 10 years. If the company can positively tackle this, it can greatly benefit the organisation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Based on Distance From Home:\n",
    "A large number of employees are residing close to the company (50% of the employees are at a distance of 7km). There is a possibility that accomodation facilities are provided by the company, since the maximum count of employees are at a distance of 2 km.\n"
